The purpose of this application is to provide a platform  where 
people can post properties for sale or rent e.g Houses.



## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (which comes with `pip`) installed on your computer.

```
python@3.6.0 or higher
pip@20.0 or higher
git@2.20.0 or higher

## How To run application üîß

From your command line, first clone property-deals:
### This command works on Linux and Mac and Windows

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/devsbranch/property-deals.git

# Go into the repository
cd property-deals
```

Then you can install the dependencies using PIP:

### On Linux and Mac
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pip3 install -r requirememts.txt

# Start development server
$ python3 run.py
```

### On Windows
Use Powershell, Command Prompt or Windows Terminal

```bash
# Install dependencies
PS> pip install -r requirememts.txt

# Start development server
PS> python run.py

```

##Setting Up the Database
Once you run the application for the first time, it will automatically create an SQlite database file if that's what is configured. 
Otherwise, you have to create a database. A Postgres database is preferred but feel free to use whichever you want. See the 
examples below on how to create a Postgres database using the command line or using Valentina Studio. You can use whatever 
database management tool you prefer. I will be using Valentina Studio.
### Using Command line
Ensure Postgres is properly installed on your machine.

### Using Valentina Studio
Valentina Studio is available on Linux,Windows and Mac. So the steps here will work on these platforms

### Connection String
In your application, you have to configure the flask application to use the Postgres database.
Your connection string format should be like this: 
`postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`
You have to set a password for connecting to Postgres or else Valentina Studio won't connect.
Here is an example on a connection string `postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/property_deals`


#### As you can see in the above steps, the app automatically creates the tables once its run for the first time after you create the database.

##### To start using the app, start the server has and go to this url `http://localhost:5000/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server and will show you a login page.
